## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** to customer transaction data in order to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By integrating customer demographics, the analysis provides deeper insights into customer groups, enabling targeted marketing and retention strategies.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (for data extraction and cleaning)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis and visualization)

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Merged transaction data with customer demographics.  
   - Cleaned and transformed data for RFM analysis.  

2. **RFM Calculation**  
   - **Recency (R):** Days since last purchase.  
   - **Frequency (F):** Number of purchases.  
   - **Monetary (M):** Total profit spent by the customer.  
   - Divided metrics into **quartiles** to assign RFM scores.  

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Classified customers into meaningful segments (e.g., Champions, Loyal, At-Risk).  
   - Visualized **age group distributions** and **spending behavior** using bar plots.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights
- Identified high-value customers with frequent, recent purchases.  
- Found at-risk customers who have not purchased in a long time.  
- Segmented customers by **age group and spending pattern** to support personalized campaigns.  

## ðŸ“· Sample Visualizations
- Age Group Distribution (New vs Old Customers)  
- Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value Segmentation
